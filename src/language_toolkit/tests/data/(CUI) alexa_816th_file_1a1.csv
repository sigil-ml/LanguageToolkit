Talked with the AC on the sequence and decision. He said that the crew was already delayed in the step because crew comm wasn't present to pick up comsec. After getting to the jet, mx told the crew that the ER was good but they had to go black jet quick. At that point, the transloading was paused between the Rhino team handling haz cargo and the ATOC team. When the APU was shut down, the door stayed cracked partially open for approx 2 mins. ""APU door disag"" stayed on the WAP. Mx inspection revealed that the prox sensor on the door was corroded. Mx informed the crew that there was one of two fixes: safe the door or replace the sensor. Each fix was billed as a 1.5 to 2 hour fix. At that point, the Pro Sup told the crew he wasn't aware of the door issue the night previous when it had been written up (APU door disag has been a constant issue for other crews and even annunciated in the high speed regime on a takeoff). Pro Sup then said he was only aware of it when mx got to the jet at 1000Z (crew got there at 1100Z). He then left for a meeting. During this time, mx at the jet passed an ETIC to ATOC and Rhino, but not to the crew. ATOC decided to go service other jets in sequence, and Rhino took the haz cargo back to the loading shed. Power was then applied to the jet with a power cart, but without air, an avionics overheat occurred. So without a solid ETIC, mx giving an unofficial timeline of 2 hours at takeoff time, collective crew fatigue, and no ATOC/rhino presence at the jet (they would show to load after the mx was performed), the AC elected to cancel. Contributing to the decision was the fact that the delay to complete mx and then load would push a takeoff time pushing well past maximum FDP for their basic crew. ",,[],f,,1,0,0,0

,,,,,,,,,,," Also, the MRT arrived but was only 1 jet troop not the 2 troops requested. They can't complete the Boeing READY because they need two jet troops for that fix. This will require the MXG/CC to allow me to sign off the red X. I will work that and let you know when we are approved to take the jet.

The FCC said the TR will be fixed in 2-3 hours. The only reason we need the approval is it needs 2 jet troop signatures and we only have 1. Besides that the jet itself will be ready to fly tomorrow.  1000z departure sounds great and I will put the Crew into crew rest to meet that takeoff time.,,[],f,,1,0,0,0

Last time we did this, we were given 3+45 on the ground at OKAS which was way too long. Mx did not have the jet ready to go because they were working of a normal 3+45 sequence. If we still planned 3+45 for the swap, it would add about 1+30 to the day. As long as the MOG/PPR works out at OSRZ for the jet to arrive 1+30 later it could work.

,,,,,,,,,,," There was a question about a DV who was code 4 (CAT A, PRI 4, A4).  I have no problem with you putting a MC on there, i was trying to give you the option.  if you want an MC, i dont care.  Feel free to call US though, not AMD.  AMD will only defer to us, who are again trying to give you the option.

Spoke with Major Hodges and in the FTIP review it mentions crew can get NOTAMs enroute with ATC which trumps the note about Day/VFR only due to lack of ability to obtain NOTAMs. Waiting on a call back from Major Hodges, he's reaching out to the TERPS guys to confirm we're interpreting that correctly. Also, if approaches are valid due to the first 1000' of the runway being unusable because of WBC if weight is going to be an issue.

If a mission is re-cut, it is also re-scored so everything in execution is g2g regarding approval as long as the score doesn't elevate above what's been approved. So, if your guys are stepping and have a high ORM approved by a planner and their aircrew score keeps them Moderate or Low, you (mod) or the AC (low) are good to talk through the mitigation steps among yourselves and continue with the step process/no need to reach back.
