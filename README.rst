LanguageToolkit
===============

LanguageToolkit is a set of tools for working with natural language data. This project
includes tools that are used in various projects and will expand as the necessity arises.

We welcome contributors to this project. Our team strongly believe in the open source
community and provide these tools to help others in their research and development. We use
many open source tools in our projects and we are happy to give back to the community.

If there are any issues that are found, please report them to one of the contributors and
we will address them as soon as possible.

Currently there are the following tools available:

- `StringFilter` - A tool for filtering strings based on a set of rules and weak learners.
